6. Monthly Rides and Monthly Bike Usage.
<br>
Looking at both charts we can see that summer months (June, July, August) are the most popular months among both Citi Bike members and casual riders. 
<br>
Citi Bike member numbers held stronger than casual riders as the year went on. This is likely to be affected by an increase in memberships being sold.
<br>
While Electric bike usage peeaked in June, the Classic bike peak was in August and the oveall usage of Classic bikes held on stronger in the latter months of 2022 when compared to the comparison between both bike types in the early months of 2022.
